# 2023 Cohere Large Language Model (LLM) notes and projects

This repository contains notes and projects from the LLM University non-credentialed courses offered by Cohere. 

Jupyter notebooks for notes and projects are denoted by ``notes_modX_x...``, respectively, where ``X`` specifies the module of LLM University, and `x` refers to the order it was made. So ``notes_mod1_1_...`` refers to Module 1 notes, first notes and ``notes_mod1_2...`` is the second page of notes that follows.
